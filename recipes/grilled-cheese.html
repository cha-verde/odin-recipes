        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This Italian marinated grilled cheese is made by briefly marinating 3 kinds of cheese with a quick oil and vinegar dressing, and including a few things you typically find in antipasto. It’s a new and amazing twist on the classic grilled cheese sandwich.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <h4>Cheese Filling</h4>

                <li>1 pinch chili flakes</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs</li>
                <li>2 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, grated</li>
                <li>2 ounces Cheddar cheese, grated</li>
                <li>1 slice provolone, quartered</li>
                <li>1 rounded tablespoon diced roasted red peppers</li>
                <li>1 rounded tablespoon diced pickled pepperoncini peppers</li>
                <li>1 rounded tablespoon diced green olives</li>

            <h4>Sandwich</h4>
                <li>2 thick slices French bread</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk garlic, vinegar, olive oil, black pepper, chili flakes, and herbs together in a bowl; stir in Monterey Jack, Cheddar, and provolone cheeses until combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in red peppers, pepperoncini, and olives. Wrap and let marinade in fridge for 15 minutes, or up to several hours.</li>
            <li>Pile the marinated cheese, beginning with the provolone, evenly onto 1 bread slice; cover with the other slice. Heat olive oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. </li>
            <li>Fry sandwich until both sides are crisp and well-browned, and cheese filling has melted, about 3 minutes per side.</li>
